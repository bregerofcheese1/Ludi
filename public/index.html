<h1>ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>
<p>To the 10 or so people who had the link to this site, I'm going to be shutting it down.</p>
<p>Heroku (The site I've been hosting Ludicrous on for free) is removing the ability to create free websites starting November. I'm not going to be paying to host Ludicrous on a website when many others host it for free. I decided to use my limited HTML knowledge from CS class to make this announcement page. This is the end of itsonlyasite/pleasedontblockthisgoogle.</p>
<h1>WHAT NOW?</h1>
<p>I'd recommend joining the TitaniumNetwork official discord server (https://discord.gg/unblock), they actually make Ludicrous and many other web proxies just like it. Simply go to #proxy-talk and use the command /proxy [site] to get a link to a site running Ludicrous, or many other great web proxies. The #kajigs channel is also pretty cool aswell.</p>
<h1>CREDITS</h1>
<p>TitaniumNetwork - Made everything on Ludicrous, except for the free games hosted.</p>
<p>Me - Hosted it for free on Heroku, to get a personalized and unblocked link for me and some of my friends.</p>
<h1>THE END</h1>
